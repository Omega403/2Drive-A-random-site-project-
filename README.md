# A random site project 🌐

Hi, this is a website I created out of boredom. This site is all about a random topic (the guide) and was designed to showcase responsive web design techniques using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## - About the site 🛈

I called this website  "2Drive" in the sense of "To drive" and this is a responsive website that adapts to different screen sizes. On desktops, you'll find a classic header menu, while on mobile devices, it features a convenient hamburger menu for easy navigation.

This is the site hosted on "Netlify": https://2driveit.netlify.app
